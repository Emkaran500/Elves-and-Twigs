Board Zones

First zone entry - the forest
The woods unfold before you, once joyful vistas, now barren. Only dread lives here and even the light seems to avoid this place.

Second zone entry - the swamp
The pungent smell, the mosquitos fat with bloodâ€¦ The Swamp of Purity had only grown, its gaping maws eagerly awaiting new travelers.

Third zone entry - the Valley of Sacrifice
This had once been a path rich with flowerbeds, the pride of Fleetfoots. Now, under the corrupted gaze of The One Who Upholds, only thorns remain, eager to feast.

Fourth zone entry - the Cemetery
A grim reminder at the very end of the journey. Though the body may yet flourish, the soul shall never be the same. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here, less you wish to join the ever-growing army of the dead.
